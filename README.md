# MKR1010-WiFi-Thingsboard

This project is aimed to use MQTT protocol IoT with an Arduino MKR1010 WiFi. It was made by programming with Arduino IDE, PubSubClient and WiFiNINA library. We can send the data to the ThingsBoard cloud in real-time. The data can be visualized in ThingsBoard. 

A network sensor system consisting of an Arduino MKR1010 WiFi module as internet connectivity and used to measure air temperature and humidity using DHT22 sensor module. Data transmission used in a communication protocol is Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) using PubSubClient library in which sensors are connected to the ThingsBoard cloud.
